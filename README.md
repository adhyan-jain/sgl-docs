# SGLang Documentation

The official documentation and cookbook for [SGLang](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang) — a high-performance serving framework for large language models and vision-language models.

- **Docs**: Getting started guides, installation, and reference
- **Cookbook**: Battle-tested recipes for deploying specific models (Qwen, DeepSeek, Llama, GLM, etc.) on various hardware

### Adding a new cookbook recipe

1. Create a new `.mdx` file under `cookbook/` following the existing directory structure (e.g., `cookbook/autoregressive/<Vendor>/<Model>.mdx`)
2. Use an existing recipe like `cookbook/autoregressive/Qwen/Qwen3.5.mdx` as a template
3. Add your page to the navigation in `docs.json`
4. Each recipe should include:
   - Model introduction and key specs
   - Installation / environment setup
   - Deployment configuration (with hardware recommendations)
   - Usage examples (basic + advanced)
   - Benchmarks (if available)

### Writing guidelines

- Use active voice: "Run the command" not "The command should be run"
- Address the reader as "you"
- Keep sentences concise — one idea per sentence
- Lead with the goal, then the steps
- Use consistent terminology
- Include concrete examples and code snippets
